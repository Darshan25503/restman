## 📋 Environment Variables

The environment automatically manages these variables:

| Variable | Description | Auto-populated |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `auth_base_url` | Auth service URL | No (default: http://localhost:8001) |
| `restaurant_base_url` | Restaurant service URL | No (default: http://localhost:8002) |
| `order_base_url` | Order service URL | No (default: http://localhost:8003) |
| `user_email` | Your email for auth | No (you must set this) |
| `session_token` | Session token from auth | Yes (after OTP verification) |
| `user_id` | User ID (used as Owner ID) | Yes (after OTP verification) |
| `restaurant_id` | Created restaurant ID | Yes (after creating restaurant) |
| `category_id` | Created category ID | Yes (after creating category) |
| `food_id` | Created food item ID | Yes (after creating food) |
| `order_id` | Created order ID | Yes (after creating order) |

---

## 🎯 Testing Tips

### 1. Sequential Testing
Follow the workflow in order - each step builds on the previous one.

### 2. Check Console
Open Postman Console (View > Show Postman Console) to see:
- Auto-saved variables
- Request/response logs
- Debug information

### 3. Ownership Verification
All write operations (create, update, delete) verify ownership using the `X-Owner-Id` header.

### 4. Caching Behavior
The menu endpoint is cached in Redis:
- **TTL**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Cache Key**: `menu:{restaurant_id}`
- **Invalidation**: Automatic on any menu update (restaurant, category, or food changes)
- **Test**: Call "Get Full Menu" twice - second call should be faster (served from cache)

### 5. Event Publishing
All operations publish events to Kafka:
- **Menu Events**:
  - **Topic**: `menu.events`
  - **Events**: restaurant.created, restaurant.updated, menu.category_created, menu.food_created, etc.
- **Order Events**:
  - **Topic**: `order.events`
  - **Events**: order.placed, order.status_updated
- **Check**: View Kafka UI at http://localhost:8080 to see events

### 6. Order Status Flow
Orders follow a specific status flow:
```
PLACED → ACCEPTED → IN_PROGRESS → READY → COMPLETED
                                        ↓
                                   CANCELLED
```
- Invalid transitions will return a 400 error
- Example: Cannot go from PLACED directly to COMPLETED

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing or invalid X-Owner-Id header"
**Solution**: Make sure you've completed the authentication flow first. The `user_id` variable must be set.

### Issue: "Restaurant not found or access denied"
**Solution**: You can only modify restaurants you own. Check that the `restaurant_id` belongs to your `user_id`.

### Issue: "OTP expired"
**Solution**: OTPs are valid for 5 minutes. Request a new OTP and verify it quickly.

### Issue: "Session expired"
**Solution**: Sessions are valid for 2 hours. Re-authenticate by requesting and verifying a new OTP.

### Issue: "Service unavailable"
**Solution**:
1. Check that Docker containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check that services are running:
   - Auth Service: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/auth/health`
   - Restaurant Service: `curl http://localhost:8002/api/health`
   - Order Service: `curl http://localhost:8003/api/health`

### Issue: "Invalid status transition"
**Solution**: Orders must follow the valid status flow. Check the current order status and ensure you're transitioning to a valid next status.

### Issue: "Food not available"
**Solution**: The food item must have `is_available = true` in the Restaurant Service. Update the food item to make it available.

### Issue: "External service error"
**Solution**: Order Service depends on Restaurant Service. Ensure Restaurant Service is running and accessible at http://localhost:8002.

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Testing Cache Invalidation
1. Get the menu (cached)
2. Update a food item
3. Get the menu again (cache invalidated, fresh data)

### Testing Ownership
1. Create a restaurant with one user
2. Try to update it with a different `X-Owner-Id`
3. Should receive "access denied" error

### Bulk Testing
Use Postman's Collection Runner to run all requests in sequence automatically.
